 <h1>Q's webDev site</h1>
 
 <p> I am a senior of UNA and this a site of  website building advise.</p>
 <p> First of all always put doctype html in the begining of page,it lets the broweser know what kind of webpage it is opening an what version of java it is.
 Don't let user use browser controls for your website instead take control of your website and have navigation built in it.</p>
 <p>Keep all the your resources for you webpage together in one folder, make sure to give the folder and its contents simple names.</p>
